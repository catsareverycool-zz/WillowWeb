      <h4>Reduced Fare Program</h4>
      <div class="text">Special rates are available for senior citizens 62 years of age or older and people with disabilities. Personal assistants ride for free when proper identification is presented by the person with a disability. And you don't need to be a New Jersey resident to be eligible for the program.</div>
      <h4>Boarding The Train</h4>
      <div class="text">Bridge plates are available at all high and mini high-level platforms. These plates bridge the gap between the platform and the train for safer and easier boarding and disembarking. Upon request, a member of the crew will assist with a bridge plate. Before a customer using a mobility device boards the train, you should inform the train crew of your destination.</div>
